# CIT 281 lab 02

## Outcome:

This lab continued the focus on the command line where the last lab left off. 
This lab cntinued to develop skills with git to create repositorys and commit material.
We learned about cloning repositorys and updating version control to the cloud for GitHub.
This lab had us download a game from GitHub and experiment with running it from the terminal.

## Code:

```javascript
function square(num)
{
    return num*num; 
}
console.log('Square operations:')
for (let i = 2; i <= 10; i+=2)
{
    console.log(`Square of ${i} is ${square(i)}`);
}
console.log(`Square of 20 is ${square(10)}`);
```
